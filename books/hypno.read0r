Speed reading is a way to hipnotize any trainer in the academy of telerik. Just a few hundred words displayed by the spead reading app "Read0r" are enough to put the trainer reading them under your complete control. Then just clap your hands once to make the trainer give you a perfect score. Clap your hands twice more to make them give you a bonus reward.
